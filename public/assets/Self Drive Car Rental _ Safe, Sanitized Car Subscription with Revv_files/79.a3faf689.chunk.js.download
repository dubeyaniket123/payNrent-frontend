If you go for the \u201cUnlimited kms\u201d pricing plans (available only without fuel, and only for bookings whose duration is more than 24 hours), there is absolutely no limit to the kilometres that you can drive, and you have complete flexibility of driving the car as much as you want. Revv it up! Other pricing plans have a "Kilometres limit", which varies based on the plan selected. You can still drive beyond the kilometres limit, but the additional kilometres clocked will attract an additional charge. For outstation one-way trips, each route has a fixed "Kilometres limit", based on the distance between source and destination. You can still drive beyond the kilometres limit, but the additional kilometres clocked will attract an additional charge. For Switch, there is a monthly limit of 2500 Kms. This limit has been designed to ensure that it should suffice for the vast majority of private usage requirements. You can still drive beyond the kilometer limit, but the additional kilometer clocked will attract an additional charge. The Kms will accumulate, on a pro-rata basis, for the period of your subscription (e.g. if you subscribe for 6 months, you will be entitled to 15,000 Kms, beyond which there will be an additional charge per km).'}},{"@type":"Question",name:"Are there restrictions on where I can travel?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"All of our cars are equipped with an All India Tourist Permit, so you are free to drive anywhere in the country.
